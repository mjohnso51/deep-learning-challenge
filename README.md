# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview/Background:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
Here we read in the .csv file and removed unnecessary columns, EIN & NAME.  These columns were removed because they would not be necessary for helping the model in its predictions.  All other data was featured.

### Compiling, Traning, and Evaluating the Model - 
For my optimization attempts, I originally used two nodes in my Neural Network and the 'relu' activation tool.  This generated an accuracy of 72.54%.  On my second attempt I did all the same except this time, I used three nodes in my Neural Network.  This increased accuracy to 73.01%.  So I stuck with the three nodes for the rest of my optimazations.  In my third attempt, I added the validation_split function when training the model.  At 15%, this led to a slight decrease in accuracy to 72.93%.  Finally, I removed the validation_split and tried out activation 'tanh' when defining the Neural Network.  This also led to a decrease in accuracy to 72.87%.  Unfortunately,  I was not able to reach the 75% accuracy goal in my attempts.

## Summary:
Overall, there was a lot to do for this assignment, there are any number of combinations of nodes and activations that you could use for this project.  I am sure there is a program out there that can optimize this process.  But from my experience on this assignment, I found that 3 nodes in the Neural Network were optimal.  In the future I would experiment more with Activations like 'tanh' and 'sigmoid'.
