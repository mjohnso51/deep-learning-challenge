# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview/Background:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
Here we read in the .csv file and removed unnecessary columns, EIN & NAME.  These columns were removed because they would not be necessary for helping the model in its predictions.  All other data was featured.

### Compiling, Traning, and Evaluating the Model - 
For my optimization attempts, I originally used two nodes in my Neural Network.  However, I increased that number to 3 and found that my accuracy dropped from 72.8% to 72.5%, so for my third attempt I went back to using two nodes.  In my third attempt,
